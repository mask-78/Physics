## Introduction

Thermodynamics is the phenomenological(based on physical observations) description of properties of macroscopic systems in thermal equilibrium.

- Idealize the system. First examine closed, isolated system and then move onto open and interacting systems.
- A State funtion is a thermodynamic coordinate that describes the state of system. They are valid only when the system is in equilibrium w.r.t a given observation time scale. The dependence on an observation time scale makes equilibrium a subjective quatitiy.
- The relationship between these state functions is described by the Laws of Thermodynamics and their mathematical framework, which are based on emperical observations and more fundamental laws (microscopic) are needed for their justification.

## Zeroth Law

> If two systems A and B are in equilibrium with a third system C, then they are also in equilibrium with each other.

It is assumed that each system is separately in mechanical equilibrium. If systems are allowed to work on each other then additional conditions constraints must be put to describe their joint mechanial equilibrium.

We can describe a constaint equation b/w A, C and B, C and from the Zeroth Law this constraint must also exist b/w A,B. This gives us the definition of _emperical temerature_ *T*. There can be many potential choices of what this constraint might be but the essential idea is the existence of such a function itself.

Isotherms of a system are described by the constaint $$T = const.$$

### Ideal Gas Temp Scale 

Ideal gas is _dilute limit_ of a real gas and from emperical observations, we see that the product of Pressure and Volume remain constant along an isotherm of such ideal gas. We can describe the Kelvin temperature scale using the ideal gas. 
- 0K is the temperature at which the ideal gas attains 0 volueme.
- The ideal gas temperature is proportional $$PV$$ and at 273.16K $$PV_{system}=PV_{triple-point-of-water}$$
- Hence, T = $$273.16*\frac{PV_{system}}{PV_{tpow}}$$
